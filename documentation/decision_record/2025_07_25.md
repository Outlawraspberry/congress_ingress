On the 25.07 we decided to rearrange the concept a bit.

- The game's tick will be used as an archive, the actual game state is saved now in the point itself.
- User actions will be saved as a history.
- A user will have an action cooldown
- Actions will be performed immediately, instead of all X ticks
