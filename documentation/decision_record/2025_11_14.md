# Point Level

## Concept

How to add base building to the game? Point Levels.

A point will have a level with a configurable max level, by default 3, but changeable in the game's config.
With each level, the point's max health will be increase.
Each level will give additional configured max health (by default 255).

So the point is on level 3, so it has 3 * 255 = 765 health points.

To level a point, the health has to be at max health, then a user can perform the upgrade action to level up the point.
After the update, the points's max health has increased, but the users has to repair it to the full new max health.

So after the update the point has 2 * 255 of 3 * 255 HP.

How to handle level 0?

Level 0 has a max healh of 0, so it can be claimed immediatlelly and the level increases by 1.
To be fair, the point should then have 128 HP to not be play the ping poing claim game.
