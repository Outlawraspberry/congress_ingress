# Congress Quest 🗺

Congress quest (CQ) is a capture the flag like game / prototype inspired by Ingress. 
The game is running a limited time and is playable in a specific location.

The initial idea is, to play the game on the chaos communication congress (C3). 
The C3 is happening in the CCH (Congress Center Hamburg) between Christmas and new year. 
In the building and surrounding area, congress quest will be playable. 
If you are an explorer, you'll find a lot of nice and funny stuff on the congress. 
Especially in the corners and some non main stream spots. 
To encourage visitors to explore more, congress quest was invented.

The base idea of CQ is to place points, like a stronghold or a portal like in ingress, everywhere on the area. 
These points can be placed at specific sights or points of interest, like the main hall or something else.

The points are visible through the CQ client and users can interact by the client with the points. 
Points are claimed or unclaimed by faction and depending if the user is part of a faction or not, he can claim, attack or repair one of the points.

In CQ, there are factions and a user is part of a faction.
In name of a faction a users can interact with the points in the world.
A point which is not claimed, can be claimed by any faction
A point that is claimed by an opponent faction can be attack and claimed at the end
A point owned by the own faction can be repaired.

But what's the goal of the game? The goal is to claim as much points for the user's faction and of course have fun!
